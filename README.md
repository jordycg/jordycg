## Hi there! 👋

I'm a current student and aspiring developer at [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/), pursuing my second bachelor's in Software Engineering. My first degree is a B.S. in Exercise Science, and I've discovered how both health and technology play a vital role in our wellbeing.

I'm passionate about making a positive impact and always eager to learn new things. Currently, I'm working on enhancing my front-end development skills and building projects that reflect my passions.
