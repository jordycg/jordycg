## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current student / aspiring developer at Western Governers University pursuing a second bachelor's in Software Engineering. My first degree is a B.S. in Exercise Science and I've learned how both health and tech play a role in the upkeep of our wellbeing.

I'm passionate about making a change and learning new things.
